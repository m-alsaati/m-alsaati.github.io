							<h2>ECG Acquisition and Heart Rate Measurement</h2>
							<p>An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a simple, non-invasive procedure that measures the heart's electrical activity.
								Electrodes are placed on certain areas of the body to pick up the natural electrical activity that coordinates
								atrial and ventricular contractions. In order to measure the electrocardiogram (ECG) of the subject, two
								electrodes are applied, one on the right wrist and the other on the left wrist. The two electrodes
								pick up on the heart's electrical activity and transmit this information to the signal filtering and
								amplification stage of the circuit.</p>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/signal.PNG" alt="" style="width: 75%; height: auto; object-fit: cover;"/></span>A real-world unfiltered ECG
								signal was taken from the Physionet database and is used in this project. To simulate real-world noise that would obstruct our signal, a thermal 
								noise generator was used to mimic thermal noise from the subject's body. A 220 mV battery was used to mimic the half-cell potential of the Ag/AgCl 
								electrodes, and a 60 Hz power source was used to mimic the 60 Hz powerline interference from common electronics.</p>
							<p style="clear: both;"><span class="image right"><img src="images/electrodes.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover;"/></span>
								To represent the 
								electric connection between an electrode and the skin through the agency of electrolyte gel, we must have an equivalent circuit as shown on the right, 
								showing the total electrical equivalent circuit. The dermis and the subcutaneous layer of the subject's skin under the electrodes behave in general as 
								pure resistance.</p>
							<p style="clear: both;"><span class="image left"><img src="images/protection_circuit.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover;"/></span>
								A protection circuit made up of diodes, capacitors, and resistors serves the purpose of preventing current from flowing back towards the patient,  
								increasing the safety of this circuit.
								The diodes also provide a path for current to flow to ground in case of a power surge since the
								diodes only require a small voltage of ~0.7 V to become a short circuit. 
							</p>
							<p style="clear: both;"><span class="image right"><img src="images/ins_amp.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover;"/></span>
								Instrumentation Amplifier provides very high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), meaning it filters out noisy signals that are common to both
								inputs (electrodes). Also provides high input impedance and is easily adjustable so gain can be changed as needed.
							</p>
							<p style="clear: both;"><span class="image left"><img src="images/bandpass.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover;"/></span>
								Band-pass Filter is used to filter out a specific frequency of noise. In our case, we want to filter out the 60 Hz powerline interference from our 
								signal.
							</p>
							<p style="clear: both;"><span class="image right"><img src="images/highpass.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover;"/></span>
								High-pass Filter is used to filter out low frequency noise below the frequency range of our signal including baseline wander/drift, such as the 
								half-cell potential caused by the electrodes.
							</p>
							<p style="clear: both;"><span class="image left"><img src="images/lowpass.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover;"/></span>
								A Low-pass Filter is used to filter out high frequency noise above the frequency range of our signal.
							</p>
							<p style="clear: both;"><span class="image right"><img src="images/iso.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover;"/></span>
								Another electrical safety component. The Isolation Amplifier provides electrical isolation of signal acquisition, filtering and
								amplification stage and the signal processing stage of the circuit. Doing this allows us to have a separate
								power source and ground connection on each side of the isolation amplifier, which prevents the formation
								of ground loops and improves electrical safety for the patient.
							</p>
							<p style="clear: both;"><span class="image left"><img src="images/comp.PNG" alt="" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover;"/></span>
								Finally, the Comparator is used to detect R waves in the ECG signal. The R wave peak of an ECG signal
								can be much greater in amplitude than the rest of the signal, meaning the reference voltage (Vref) of the
								comparator can be set at a value near the peak value of the R wave. Once the signal amplitude reaches the
								reference voltage, the comparator output flips to indicate that an R wave was detected.
